# Heriot-Watt Programming Challenge

The competition was held in Heriot-Watt University Dubai. The programming challenges were based on concepts like Anagrams, Palindromes, Matrices, File Management. I was the team leader of a team of three and we completed several programming challenges in 3 hours.
